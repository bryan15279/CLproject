# CLproject
This is my project. It is a made up car detialing business with an "About", "Services", and "Newsletter" sections.  The links at the top of the page don't work except for the Services tab.
Requirements met: 
-JavaScript requirements: Email verification.  If the field is left empty, a message will appear.  If the email entered does not include the @ symbol, it will come back as invalid.  If a valid email is entered, a confirmation message thanking the user appears.  
-There is a countdown to a sale in the middle of the page. 
-The services button at the top of the nav bar, when clicked, retrieves the services offered from an array in main.js file
-There are no special instructions required for the user to interact with this page.
