# CLproject
This is my project. It is a made up car detialing business with an "About", "Services", and "Newsletter" sections.  The links at the top of the page don't work, but have a hover affect of changing color when the pointer is over one of the links. 
Requirements met: 
-the site is mobile first, with MQs expanding on the site capabilities when made larger widths.  When the mobile site is visible, only one background image is used, and no animation is present.  The nav bar is vertical, once a certain width is crossed over, the nav bar changes to horizontal, animation is started, and background images rotate using keyframes. 
-CSS requirement: flexbox is used throughout the design
-JavaScript requirements: Email verification.  If the field is left empty, a message will appear.  If the email entered does not include the @ symbol, it will come back as invalid.  If a valid email is entered, a confirmation message thanking the user appears.  There is a countdown to a sale in the middle of the page.  
-One addtional item: The CSS animations on the larger width view with text rising from the bottom to the middle top of the screen.
-There are no special instructions required for the user to interact with this page.
